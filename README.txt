# Critical abundances of alien plants and impact onnative diversity
data import and analyses in R

This respository contains the scripts used to detect critical abundances of alien plant species associated to a decrease in native plant richness on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand.
It is ongoing, unfinished work, and still needs quite a lot of cleaning up and code improvement. A manuscript is currently in preparation to present these results.
